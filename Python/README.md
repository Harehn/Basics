# Basics
## About
This project involves the use of several languages on their own to explore their "Basics". Some things that may be easy in some languages may not be as easy in others. For example, "objects" (Via structs) in C are restricting. In Java, lambdas require an interface to be implemented. Or in Ocaml, while there is no explicit checking of type, typecasting and polymorphism allow for much more flexibility.

## Objectives
There are 4 main objectives. 
1. The first is to showcase abilities in each language.
1. The second is to have a library of most common things needed in a language so that I may quickly reference it. In short, a personalised cheatsheet and guide.
1. The third objective is to compare and contrast different languages so that when needing to make choices between some of them. A clearer idea may be made.
1. The third objective is for learning new languages, the basics of what I am expected to know is clearly shown.

# Important
Each language is on its own branch, so feel free to browse. Python3 is the default branch because master being the default and being empty caused some problems.
